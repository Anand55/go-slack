# go-slack
Golang script to send and receive message to Slack


This code uses the github.com/slack-go/slack package to interact with the Slack API. It sends a message to the "#general" channel and then retrieves the conversation history for that channel, printing out each message in the history.

Note that you will need to set the SLACK_TOKEN environment variable to a valid Slack API token in order for this code to work.
